This directory contains files for iRODS utilities.

At the moment it is only the 'ifind' utility.

The files in this directory are:
  Makefile          make file
  LICENSE           is a license file with a permissive BSD license
  README            this readme file
  ifind.c           C source file for the ifind utility
  ifind.1           Manual page for the ifind utility
  nullcmd           Test script

The ifind utility is a bit similar to the traditional find
command in Unix.

It was born out of the issues we've had when dealing with
large directory trees in iRODS. It scans a directory tree
and executes a command for each file passing the file name
as an argument.

To list the directory tree it directly connects to the Postgres
database with the metadata so it's best to be used on the
icat host though it can take any connect string to connect
to a remote Postgres database. It is Postgres specific. It uses
cursors so it retrieves the results in batches, how many rows
to return in a batch is adjustable. It can be directed to scan
only directories or files, the full pathname is returned in
every case. The output can be sorted, reverse sort for directories
produces a canonical order traverse list.

The make file accepts the usual targets, 'all' or no
arguments to create the executable, 'test', 'install', 'clean' and
'dist' also work as expected.
